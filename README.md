AerisAndroidLibrary
================

The Aeris Maps Android Library is a development toolkits for quickly integrating HAMWeather's Aeris API and map content into your Android applications in a very easy and flexible way.

This repository contains the release verion of the library (which contains its source code in the libs folder similar to Google Play Services), and a Demo project that shows different parts of the library and API that can be leveraged by this library project. 

The Maps Library utilizes the Aeris Core Android library as well. This jar can be used stand alone from the map library, so if your project does not require maps, please use it instead. This can be found [here](http://www.hamweather.com/support/documentation/mobile/android/).
